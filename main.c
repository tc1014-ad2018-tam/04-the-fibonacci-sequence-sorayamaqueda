/*This program is designed to ask the user a number of terms by which she or he will want to recreate the
 * Fibonacci Numeric Sequence. The sequence per se is an infinite addition, ergo, and infinite loop.
 * Each term is the sum of the previous two terms; parting from 0 (firstTerm) and 1(secondTerm).
 *
 * For this program, the way we are recreating the Fibonacci Succession is with the usage of five variables. The first
 * one is call "terms" and refers to the number of terms of the series that the user wants the program to print. The
 * second and third one are call "firstTerm" and "secondTerm" respectively and hold the values of 0 and 1, respectively,
 * because those are the default starting terms of the succession. The fourth variable is call "newTerm" and refers to
 * the term that comes after the one that has just been printed. The fifth variable is call "i" and makes reference to
 * the position in which our program will start to print the succession. As default value, "i" has the value of 3 since
 * the first and second term are the values of the variables "firstTerm" and "secondTerm". As a condition for the "for"
 * loop cycle, "i" cannot be smaller than or equal to 3 because then the values will collide with the default ones and
 * the succession will not be printed correctly. Also, since the next term has to be printed next to the previous value
 * the post-incrementation value of the for is the new value of the variable "i" (++i).
